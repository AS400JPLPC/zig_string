# a big thank-you Jakub Szarkowicz  real work

This library is a UTF-8 compatible **string** library for the **Zig** programming language. 
I made this for the sole purpose to further my experience and understanding of zig.
Also it may be useful for some people who need it (including myself), with future projects. Project is also open for people to add to and improve. Please check the **issues** to view requested features.

include ziglyph

I had thought of making a lib. from icu for lower and upper transformations but the ziglyph library is not limited to that.  


# Basic Usage
```zig
const String = @import("./zig_string.zig").String;
// ...

// Use your favorite allocator
var arena = ArenaAllocator.init(std.heap.page_allocator);
defer arena.deinit();

// Create your String
var myString = String.init(&arena.allocator());
defer myString.deinit();

// Use functions provided
try myString.concat("ðŸ”¥ Hello!");
_ = myString.pop();
try myString.concat(", World ðŸ”¥");

// Success!
assert(myString.cmp("ðŸ”¥ Hello, World ðŸ”¥"));

```

# You have examples of use in zig_termcurs



# Things needed
- Optimizations
- Multi-Language toUppercase & toLowercase
- Better documentation
- More Testing

# How to Contribute
1. Fork
2. Clone
3. Add Features (Use Zig FMT)
4. Make a Test
5. Pull Request
6. Success!

# update oct 2022  
- delete truncate
- new normalize
- new StringTo
- new findPos
- new cloneDef
- change toOwned if (self.buffer != null) to if (self.len() != 0)
- change toLowercase toLowerStr include ziglyph
- change toUppercase toUpperStr include ziglyph  
- rectification beug  to insert expand  delete( *2 len buffeur ) 
- I tested 90% full process
